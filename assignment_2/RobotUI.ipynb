    "**Explanation of RobotUI Class: Graphical User Interface for Robot Interaction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code snippet introduces a Python class named `RobotUI` that serves as the foundation for a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to interact with various aspects of a robot's behavior. This GUI encompasses functionalities related to the robot's position, manipulation of target positions, and the presentation of obstacle distances. In the constructor method (`__init__()`), the class initializes attributes responsible for storing the robot's current position, managing different categories of target positions (both those that are set and those that are cancelled), and keeping track of the closest detected obstacle distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate interaction with the robot and environment, the class subscribes to specific ROS (Robot Operating System) topics, including '/odom' for odometry data and '/scan' for laser scan information. Leveraging the `ipywidgets` library, the class creates widgets that convey crucial data to the user. These widgets include labels for displaying the robot's position, presenting information about target positions, and indicating the distance to the closest obstacle. When an instance of `RobotUI` is instantiated, the graphical elements are displayed within the Jupyter Notebook interface, enhancing user-friendliness and enabling seamless interaction with the robot's state and surroundings."

    "# Interactive Robot Motion Planning Interface with Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code implementation, we create an interactive user interface using Jupyter Notebook to facilitate motion planning for a robot in a simulated environment, based on the ResearchTrack 1 Assignment #2. The interface offers users the ability to control the robot's motion, set and cancel target positions, visualize the robot's trajectory and target positions, monitor obstacle distances, and gain insights into the success and failure of goal achievements. Leveraging the power of IPython widgets, ROS (Robot Operating System) integration, and data visualization techniques, this interactive interface enhances the user's ability to intuitively interact with the robot's motion planning process. Through the use of interactive sliders and dynamic visualizations, users can efficiently set, cancel, and track goals, contributing to a more seamless and engaging motion planning experience aligned with the objectives of ResearchTrack 1 Assignment #2."

    "The provided code snippet defines two callback functions within the `RobotUI` class: `odom_callback()` and `scan_callback()`. These functions respond to incoming ROS messages of type Odometry and LaserScan, respectively. The `odom_callback()` function processes Odometry messages to extract the robot's current position from the received message and subsequently invokes the `update_widgets()` method to refresh the user interface widgets. Similarly, the `scan_callback()` function handles LaserScan messages, extracting the minimum distance to the closest obstacle from the message and then updating the `closest_obstacle_distance` attribute. Once again, the `update_widgets()` method is called to ensure that the user interface reflects the updated data. These callback functions play a vital role in maintaining the real-time interaction between the robot's state and the graphical user interface, enhancing the user's understanding of the robot's surroundings.\n",
