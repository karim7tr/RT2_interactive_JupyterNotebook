# Interactive Robot Motion Planning Interface

This project implements an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) in Jupyter Notebook for motion planning of a mobile robot. It's based on ResearchTrack 1 Assignment #2, providing controls to set/cancel targets, visualize trajectory, monitor obstacles, and track goal achievements.

## Getting Started

1. Install ROS Dependencies: `sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-rosbridge-suite` and `sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-tf2-web-republisher`.
2. Launch ROS Nodes: `roslaunch your_package_name your_launch_file.launch`.
3. Run Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`.
4. Open `Robot_Motion_Planning_Interface.ipynb`.
5. Interact: Use buttons/sliders to control robot motion, set/cancel targets, visualize trajectory, and view obstacle distance.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for robot motion planning.
- Interactive sliders for target control.
- Real-time trajectory and target visualization with ROS3D.
- Closest obstacle distance display.
- Goal achievement status bar plot.
- ROS integration for Odometry and LaserScan.
- IPython widgets for dynamic interactions.

## Prerequisites

- ROS installed.
- Jupyter Notebook installed.
